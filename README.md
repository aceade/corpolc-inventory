# CORPOLC INVENTORY SYSTEM

## About

This is a project/employee/site directory for a fictional evil corporation. I started this as some basic Spring practice, but decided to expand it as a means of teaching myself penetration testing.

#### Things to note:

* It is *not* for production use!
    * There will be vulnerabilities, so I can teach myself some penetration testing.
    * There will be jokes, references to various memes, and other nonsense.
    * This currently only supports a Postgresql database. I do not intend to support others in the foreseeable future.
    * There will not be a frontend for this; it is purely a JSON REST interface.
