# CORPOLC INVENTORY SYSTEM

## About

This is a somewhat satirical project/employee/site directory for a fictional evil corporation. I started this as some basic Spring practice, but decided to expand it as a means of teaching myself penetration testing.

#### Things to note:

* It is *not* for production use!
** There will be vulnerabilities, so I can teach myself some penetration testing.
** There will be jokes, references to various memes, and other nonsense.
