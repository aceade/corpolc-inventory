# CORPOLC INVENTORY SYSTEM

## About

This is a project/employee/site directory for a fictional corporation. I started this as some basic Spring practice, but decided to expand it as a means of teaching myself vulnerability scanning.

#### Things to note:

* It is *not* for production use!
    * There will be vulnerabilities, so I can teach myself how to scan for vulnerabilities.
    * There may be jokes, references to various memes, and other nonsense.
    * This currently only supports a Postgresql database. I do not intend to support others in the foreseeable future.
    * It runs on an embedded Tomcat server that is not set up for secure connections.
